# Using the Intercom

When someone buzzes in (they press 4722 + ðŸ””) the intrecom will make a sound.

To let them in, follow these steps:

1. Pick up the headset, you can talk with the person below.
2. If you would like to let then thru the glass door, press the **key** button.
3. To enable the lift access press the middle button.

The lift access will allow them to press the **9** button in the lift. If they do not get a lift within a couple
of minutes, the activation will fail and they will be required to ring again.

The following video walks you through the process:
